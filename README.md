# Lesion Tracker: A tool for tracking lesions in medical images

It is important to monitor the treatment response in longitudinal studies and to keep track of the progression of the disease in clinical trials, especially for patients with advanced disease states, such as cancer. Medical images play a crucial role in this process. Accuately identifying lesions across serial imaing follow-up is a challenge. In this project,we manage to construct a deep learning framework from ground to build a toolbox for tracking lesions in medical images.
